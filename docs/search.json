The course can be broadly broken down into three sections. The first section will include communicating and working with data in a modern era.

The second part of the course will focus on traditional statistical inference done through computational methods (e.g., permutation tests and bootstrapping). The last part of the course will focus on machine learning ideas such as classification, clustering, and (possibly) dimension reduction techniques. Some of the methods were invented before the ubiquitous use of personal computers, but only because the calculus used to solve the problem was relatively straightforward (or because the method wasn’t actually ever used).

    "text": "Hi and welcome to my site!\nSince 2002, I have been at Pomona College where I teach lots of different kinds of statistics, taught a little bit of math once, love teaching writing with statistics, and hope to soon teach some data science.\n\nBackground\n\nMy undergraduate degree in Mathematics is also from Pomona College, where I worked with Don Bentley. I did my PhD in Statistics at UC Davis with David Rocke. I was interviewed (August 2020) for Pomona College’s Sagecast where you can hear me talk about my path.\n\nHere to learn?\n\nMe too! So many good things to learn. I’ve posted all of my course materials freely, and I hope they give you inspiration either as a teacher or a student. I’ve also written an OpenIntro  textbook with the fantastic Mine Çentinkaya-Rundel. Introduction to Modern Statistics focuses on computational inference and multivariable modeling & visualizing, and it is available for free online.\n\nInterested in my research?\n\nOne of the best things about being a statistician is the many different subject areas to pursue. My research projects are posted, but if you have time, it’s really my students’ research projects that are worth investigating. I highly recommend working with undergraduates on research as it is among the most fun and rewarding parts of my day.\nMy areas of expertise include statistical analysis of high-throughput genetic data which don’t conform to technical conditions in standard methods. I work on problems of normalizing data structures, clustering and classifying time course profiles, and creating metrics to measure a variety of signals.\nI chose to become a statistician because of the myriad potential collaborations across many fields. I have worked with medical doctors, biologists, geologists, and physicists in my research. Through new ventures into data science (both research and teaching), I am currently exploring ways that today’s extensive data (both in scale and in occurrence) are shaping science and the world around us.\n\nWant to know what I’m up to?\n\nBeyond teaching and research, I am fortunate to be able to fit in a few hours here and there on some of my passion projects. Almost every Tuesday, I wrangle a bit of TidyTuesday data. I’m also compiling a list of scholars who are traditionally underrepresented in the statistics and data science curriculum. Feel free to use the list for your own “scholar of the day” classroom activity. And please submit a pull request or a GitHub issue if you have names to add to the database!"

    "text": "Teach Data Science\n\n\nThe following entry originally appeared on May 18, 2020 at https://teachdatascience.com/keepbusy/, a blog written by Nick Horton (twitter), Hunter Glanz (twitter), and Jo Hardin (mastodon).\n\n\n\n\n\n Teach Data Science\n\n\nhttps://teachdatascience.com/\n\n\n\nIt has become increasingly clear that many college students have found themselves without summer plans. Unfortunately, this blog entry is not a list of possible employment opportunities. Instead, it is a compilation of statistics and data science projects to enhance a summer spent socially distant.\nThe list below represents opportunities at a variety of levels. If you are just beginning or quite advanced, there are many ideas for you.\n\na note on data science: as a college professor, I am often queried by my students for advice on what they should do if they want to pursue data science after their undergraduate degree. My best advice is to: do data science. That is, worry less about which classes to take or which graduate schools to apply to. Instead, worry more about learning data science skills, becoming proficient in data wrangling, and thinking critically about problem solving. Take some statistics, math, and CS classes (it doesn’t matter hugely which classes). If you have a solid background in statistics, math, and CS + some decent data science chops you will be able to accomplish whatever you want.\na note on software: The majority of the resources / links below are for doing data science in R. There are many good software options, however the resources for getting started in R are outstanding, and you are highly encouraged to check them out.\n\n\n1. GitHub\n\n\n\nWhile not necessarily the first task that you should undertake this summer, the first recommendation is to set up a GitHub account and use it to post anything you do. Each project should be a separate repository, and you should make sure to always have a README file so that others (and you six months from now) can easily see what you’ve done.\nIf you are at all serious about doing data science at any point down the road, now is the time to start collecting your data projects into a single place so that your work can be highlighted.\n\nThe ultimate site for getting GitHub up and running (and talking with RStudio) is: https://happygitwithr.com/\nIf you’d like to set up your own website, try using https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html\n\nAre you more advanced?\n\nmake your own website using bookdown, https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/\nor a blog using blogdown, https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/\n\n\n\n2. Starting with R\n\n\n\nParticularly if you are new to R, an amazing book to work through is called “R for Data Science” by Grolemund & Wickham (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). There are many problems you can try out, and the text provides a wealth of ideas for working through data analysis problems. Even if you have been using R for many years, my guess is that the text contains many opportunities to learn how to work with new data structures.\n\ninteractive tutorials for working through “R for Data Science” at https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers\nfor a good start to R in general, check out https://education.rstudio.com/learn/\nThere is a more advanced version to the Grolemund & Wickham text that you might want to try out if you are an advanced R user (“Advanced R” by Wickham, https://adv-r.hadley.nz/). The advanced version includes quite a bit on programming and why R works the way it does.\n\n\n\n3. Modeling Data\n\n\n\nInterested in modeling?\n\nfor modeling in R, visit the new tidymodels Get Started page: https://www.tidymodels.org/start/\narguably the best text on statistical learning models (and freely available!) is “An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R” by James et al. http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/\n\n\n\n4. Natural Language Processing\n\n\n\nInterested in text analysis / natural language processing?\n\nTidytext tutorials: https://computational.journalism.wisc.edu/2018/11/16/tidytext-tutorials/\nChapter 11: tidy text: https://datascienceineducation.com/c11.html\nstringr cheat sheet: https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/strings.pdf\nText datasets to get started with: https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/R-text-data\nBlog post(s) by Julia Silge: https://juliasilge.com/blog/evaluating-stm/\nJulia Silge & David Robinson’s book: https://www.tidytextmining.com/\nImplementation of Google’s BERT framework into R: https://github.com/jonathanbratt/RBERT\n\n\n\n5. Practice doing data science\n\n\n\nOne of the most fun things you can do is to practice doing data science. Below are ideas you could work on for one afternoon or that you could commit a few weeks to figuring out. You should choose projects that seem fun and to which you might be able to provide a creative approach to solving.\n\nTidy Tuesday: every Tuesday a new dataset is posted, and individuals (separately and collaboratively) work to visualize the dataset. Details at https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday.\nKaggle.com: is an online community of data scientists who build models, working together to come up with optimal predictions. You can compete in an ongoing Kaggle competition, or you can work through an old competition where many teams have shared their work and their ideas.\nWork through a COVID-19 analysis. It is worth noting that the current available case data is likely to be under-reported (both cases and deaths across most countries) which makes modeling the actual data somewhat problematic. Instead, you might try to model COVID-19 related data (e.g., flights in the US, unemployment, emissions, weather patterns, etc.).\n\n\n\nTwo good resources that have been collecting analyses and other information are: http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~kass/covid.html and https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/covid19-r\n\n\n\ndata for social good: https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/ provides real data and structures (similar to Kaggle) for working through models and coming up with predictions – all on data which benefits the social good.\nOther data science competitions: https://towardsdatascience.com/top-competitive-data-science-platforms-other-than-kaggle-2995e9dad93c\n\n\n\n6. Interactive graphics\n\n\n\nRegister for a (free) shiny account, and create a shiny dashboard to highlight the work you are doing!\n\naccount: https://shiny.rstudio.com/\ngallery: https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/\nShiny contest 2020 (deadline passed, but you can practice for next year!):\n\nhttps://blog.rstudio.com/2020/02/12/shiny-contest-2020-is-here/\n\n\n7. Art and R\n\n\n\nInterested in art? Make art with data and R!\n\nGetting started with generative art in R: https://djnavarro.net/post/unpredictable-paintings/\nNo code, but inspiration: https://www.data-imaginist.com/art\nFollow posts on Twitter:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/search?q=%23generative%20%23rstats&src=typed_query\n\nIllustrations — don’t want to code but draw instead? Illustrate your learnings! See https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations for inspiration.\nHand drawn data visualizations? See http://www.dear-data.com/theproject for inspiration.\n\n\n\n8. Watch videos and take classes\n\n\n\nLearn some new stuff from videos & webinars!\n\nRStudio has a wealth of amazing videos https://resources.rstudio.com/\nDave on Data’s youtube channel:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRhUp6SYaJ7zme4Bjwt28DQ\n\nCoursera + Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science\n\n\n\n9. Participate in the data science community\n\n\n\nEngage on RStudio Community (https://community.rstudio.com/) or https://stackoverflow.com/ – platforms for asking and answering all the questions. StackOverflow is more comprehensive, but it can be aggressive and unhelpful at times. RStudio Community is a great place for beginners and way less intimidating than SO.\n\nbe sure you know how to make a minimal reproducible example:\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example\n\nuse the reprex package in R: https://teachdatascience.com/reprex/\n\n\n\n10. Write an R package!\n\n\n\nYou’ll be surprised to learn that creating your own R package can be reasonably straightforward. Fantastic step-by-step instructions help facilitate putting the R package together.\n\nhow to do it: https://r-pkgs.org/\nreally great example to walk through: https://www.erikhoward.net/blog/how-to-create-an-r-data-package/\nwrite a package that contains (only) a cool dataset: https://teachdatascience.com/datapackage/"

He was the 7th African American to receive a PhD in mathematics. In 2012, President Obama posthumously awarded Blackwell the National Medal of Science.\nThe majority of Blackwell’s career in statistics was spent at UC Berkeley (1954-1988). However, his start at UC Berkeley was postponed due to racism in the Department of Mathematics.

After introducing students to Liz Hare’s work, it takes very little overhead to communicate to them the ways that a graphic can be made more accessible by adding alt text to each figure.\n\n\n\n\n\nR code for Ibo tweets in TidyTuesday analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent ways to annotate a figure include alt text, figure captions for the full file, and figure captions for the ggplot."

    "text": "Rafael Irizarry\nRafael Irizarry is a well known biostatistician, having done his PhD at Berkeley, worked for many years at Johns Hopkins University, and currently running a lab at Harvard as Professor of Biostatistics and at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute as Professor of Biostatistics and Computational Biology. He has dozens of online courses through the edX platform and over a hundred publications via Google scholar.\nRelevant to the CURV database however is the work that Rafael Irizarry has done in Puerto Rico. Having graduated from the University of Puerto Rico, Rafael Irizarry had a vested interest in the community that was ravaged in 2017 when Hurricane Maria, a category 5 hurricane, ravaged the island. With collaborators, Professor Irizarry performed a representative stratified sample to measure neighborhoods based on how easily accessible they were in the aftermath of the hurricane.\nThe original news reports months after the hurricane was that the official death report from Hurricane Maria was 64 people. Professor Irizarry and colleagues estimated that the number of excess deaths was 4645, with a 95% confidence interval of 793 to 8498.\nTheir work provides a myriad of topics to unpack in a statistics classroom. Some of the discussions I have had with my students include: who is doing the work to understand climate change at a global level; how is stratified sampling different from simple random samples and why can’t we always take simple random samples; and why is the CI so large?"

    "section": "Introductory Statistics Project",
    "text": "Introductory Statistics Project\nFor the last few years, I’ve used The Islands as a way to tie together many of the topics I cover in my introductory statistics course at Pomona College. I start the project early in the semester (the first exploration is done before spring break, and the pilot study is due a week after).1 When we start, there is still a lot of material left to cover, so in some ways the students are in the dark. One of the requirements is that they must choose a continuous response variable; they also need a few explanatory variables (some numeric, some categorical) and a treatment variable of interest. The treatment doesn’t have to be randomly assigned (the study could be observational), but almost every group uses a randomly assigned treatment variable in order to be able to assess causation at the end.\nAmong the very cool things on The Islands (really, go check it out yourself, there are way too many things to tell you about) is the Academy which includes journal articles describing studies that have taken place on The Islands in the last few years.\n\nIn what remains, I’ll describe some of the unique aspects of the project. Additionally, from both my perspective as well as from my students’ perspectives, I provide some of the feedback on successes and challenges of the project.\n\nPower Analysis\nOne of my favorite aspects of The Islands project is the ability for students to do a power analysis on pilot data. I find power to be a difficult concept to teach. Not only are the technical aspects usually pretty hard, but the intuition is also really hard (especially for students who haven’t yet done any data collection of their own). The power analysis part of the project allows me, the instructor, to do all of the work, and the students just need to wrap their heads around what is happening. I have each group post their data to a Google sheet, and then I pull in the data and run a quick power analysis assuming the difference in \\(\\mu\\) values is the same as what we saw with the pilot data (the difference in \\(\\bar{x}\\) values). The students then change the sample size and the effect size to come up with scenarios that would give them a power of 0.7. Their reflection has them questioning whether or not the effect size is real and whether or not they have the resources to collect the number of observations needed for a power of 0.7.\nBelow I’ve laid out the code and instruction that I give to students so that they can determine the needed sample size that would give their experiment a power of 0.7. In the sample data I’ve had half of the participants take 10g of Psilocybin Mushrooms (the other half is the control), then I have the participants balance on one leg for as long as they can (before and after the treatment, the response variable is the difference in time spent balancing).\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(googlesheets4)\ngs4_deauth()\n# a fake data collection made up for this blog entry\npilot_data &lt;- googlesheets4::read_sheet(\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U0KcehbSQkEjwDaFpUSklKmIkUTUv-C_5q2kyO1vn24/edit?usp=sharing0\") %&gt;%\n  janitor::clean_names()\n\npilot_summary &lt;- pilot_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(treatment) %&gt;%\n  summarize(n(), mean_resp = mean(difference, na.rm = TRUE),\n            s_resp = sd(difference, na.rm = TRUE))\n\npilot_summary\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  treatment                 `n()` mean_resp s_resp\n  &lt;chr&gt;                     &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Control                      12      1.25   12.6\n2 Psilocybin Mushrooms 10 g    12     13.8    15.3\n\n\nFor use in the sample size calculations, pull out each number from the summary:\n\nn1 &lt;- pilot_summary[1,2] %&gt;% pull()\nn2 &lt;- pilot_summary[2,2] %&gt;% pull()\n\nxbar1 &lt;- pilot_summary[1,3] %&gt;% pull()\nxbar2 &lt;- pilot_summary[2,3] %&gt;% pull()\n\ns1 &lt;- pilot_summary[1,4] %&gt;% pull()\ns2 &lt;- pilot_summary[2,4] %&gt;% pull()\n\n1xbar1 - xbar2\n\n2sqrt(s1^2 / n1 + s2^2/n2)\n\n\n1\n\nThe observed difference in means.\n\n2\n\nThe estimated variability for the difference in sample means.\n\n\n\n\n[1] -12.52948\n[1] 5.709265\n\n\n\nHow big should the sample size be?\nThe task is to figure out how big the sample size should be in order to reject \\(H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2\\) with power of 0.7. Reasonable assumptions will be made based on the information above.\n\nStep 1. How far will \\(\\overline{X}_1 - \\overline{X}_2\\) need to be to reject \\(H_0\\)?\nIn order to reject \\(H_0\\) at the 0.05 level (two-sided test),\n\\[\\mbox{Z-score} &gt; 1.96\\]\nWhich means: \\[\\overline{X}_1 - \\overline{X}_2 &gt; 1.96 \\mbox{ SE}\\]\n\n\nStep 2. Assume that the variability is as calculated above from the data but with new sample sizes.\nThe \\(SE(\\overline{X}_1 - \\overline{X}_2)\\) will change based on the values of \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\). Continue to use \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\) calculated from the pilot data.\nChange the values of n1_test and n2_test to see that SE_diff changes!\n\n3n1_test &lt;- 10\n4n2_test &lt;- 10\nSE_diff &lt;- sqrt(s1^2 / n1_test + s2^2/n2_test)\nSE_diff\n\n\n3\n\ntry different numbers here!\n\n4\n\ntry different numbers here!\n\n\n\n\n[1] 6.254187\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Use a normal curve to estimate power.\nFor a very rough approximation, use the normal curve to find out how often the difference in means will be above the cutoff (from Steps 1 and 2) for various true alternative hypotheses.\nIf the true alternative difference is 0.1, then xpnorm() centered at 0.1 (the curve below is not centered at zero) provides the probability that the sample difference will be above the cutoff.\nUnder the setting: \\(H_A: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0.1\\)\n\nThe alternative value of 0.1 is made up. What types of reasonable differences are suggested by the pilot data? Use those!\nDo the pilot data suggest that a reasonable difference is actually negative? If so, make sure your power calculation finds probability in the “less” direction instead of the “greater” direction (or alternatively, subtract \\(\\mu_2 - \\mu_1\\) instead of \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\)).\n\n\nlibrary(mosaic)\ncutoff &lt;- 1.96 * SE_diff\n\n5true_alt_diff &lt;- 0.1\n                       \nmosaic::xpnorm(cutoff, mean = true_alt_diff, sd = SE_diff, lower.tail = FALSE) \n\n\n5\n\ntry different numbers here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] 0.02594708\n\n\nWith samples of size 10 each, the probability of rejecting \\(H_0\\) is 0.0259471 (= the power!). Re-do steps 2 and 3 with different \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) values. What sample sizes produce a power of 0.7?\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility\nAll of the assignments are due as .pdf files which have been compiled from .Rmd files. The analyses start by pulling in the data directly from the Google sheet, and each student in the group is able to run the entire analysis from start to end. The students are comfortable working with RMarkdown, but this is the first time that their compiled analysis is a full report.\nThe project described here is for a first course in Introductory Statistics. We do not use GitHub (yet!), but we do work entirely in RMarkdown documents. We have some difficulties in getting each individual in the group to work on one .Rmd document. We use RStudio PRO, but we have not been able to set-up group sharing projects. RStudio has described products that allow groups to work simultaneously on a single document.\nRegardless, working on one report that is reproducible allowed students to bring together not only the statistical ideas from the course but also the larger ideas on how data collection, analysis, and communication all combines into a single effort.\n\n\nEthical considerations\nWhile the context, people, and data are all completely fabricated, there is still room to bring ethical considerations into the project.\nThe University of Arizona Native Nations Institute has created a policy brief on Indigenous Data Sovereignty in the United States. More materials can be found at US Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network.\nThe ethical considerations may be as simple as having the class read the policy brief and talk about how, historically, data collection has disproportionately affected different groups. In particular, collecting data is often used as a way to sustain systems of power and privilege. Although the Islands do not represent actual humans, the way we talk and think about them could impact our students directly. Additionally, for students who are soon to be data practitioners, a conversation about the power of information can help them bring positive nuance into their future work as data scientists.\nOf course, one conversation about data sovereignty will not change all systems of oppression or even, necessarily, how a group of students approaches a dataset. However, the more often the ethical considerations can be infused as part of the data analysis, the more the students will reflect on the larger and humanistic aspects of the process. Indeed, the ethical considerations could be much expanded into written reflection, student presentations, or a research project.\n\n\nPulling everything together from the entire semester\nOne of the strengths of the project is its ability to pull together many of the topics covered from throughout the semester. The students are able to use hypothesis testing to assess whether or not their randomization scheme worked. They run a power analysis and see in real time what the “next” sample (i.e., the full dataset after the pilot study) looks like in terms of spread, center, and shape.\nThe students practice making data visualizations and running tests. The last topic of the semester, multiple linear regression, shows up as a way for them to consider all of the variables collected.\nMost students are quite curious about connections to the existing literature (both in The Islands and in the real world). Some of the experiments pan out as expected, and some give strikingly different result from what is seen in the literature.\nAnd last, students get a taste for what it is like to work with data in the wild. For example, you might have noticed that the data provided had gender coded with capitals and lower-case starts. Non-systematic data coding was ubiquitous both within individual students and across group members. By making mistakes with the variable coding and writing code to clean the data, students deeply understand why having clean data to start with is so important.\n\npilot_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(treatment, gender) %&gt;%\n  summarize(mean_age = mean(age), sd_age = sd(age))\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 4\n# Groups:   treatment [2]\n  treatment                 gender mean_age sd_age\n  &lt;chr&gt;                     &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Control                   Female     34.6   22.8\n2 Control                   Male       42.7   33.2\n3 Control                   male       50.5   27.6\n4 Psilocybin Mushrooms 10 g Female     62.5   43.8\n5 Psilocybin Mushrooms 10 g Male       47.5   25.7\n6 Psilocybin Mushrooms 10 g female     77     NA  \n7 Psilocybin Mushrooms 10 g male       63     NA"

My research projects are posted, but if you have time, it’s really my students’ research projects that are worth investigating. I highly recommend working with undergraduates on research as it is among the most fun and rewarding parts of my day.\nMy areas of expertise include statistical analysis of high-throughput genetic data which don’t conform to technical conditions in standard methods. I work on problems of normalizing data structures, clustering and classifying time course profiles, and creating metrics to measure a variety of signals. I chose to become a statistician because of the myriad potential collaborations across many fields. I have worked with medical doctors, biologists, geologists, and physicists in my research.\nAnother area of my research focuses on the statistics and data science undergraduate curriculum – making it more modern and more accessible. Through new ventures into data science (both research and teaching), I am currently exploring ways that today’s extensive data (both in scale and in occurrence) are shaping science and the world around us.\n\n\n\n\n\nArt by @allison_horst\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nResearch Interests\n\n\n\n\n\nso many fun problems, so little time\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJo Hardin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\npapers + projects\n\n\nso many fun projects, so little time\n\n\nA collection of research papers, many of which were done primarily by undergraduate collaborators.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nstudent work\n\n\nnice job everyone!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

We wrote about the approach here.\nBut there are so many other fun things about the book… including emphasis on multivariable relationships through data visualization and modeling, case studies, and compelling datasets and examples.\nWe’ve organized the book into six parts: 1. Intro to data, 2. EDA, 3. regression modeling, 4. foundations of inference, 5. statistical inference, and 6. inferential modeling.\nThe R Tutorials are written using the learnr package with much of the work due to @baumerben, Andrew Bray, @yabellini, @cantoflor_87, @data_datum.\nThe R Labs have been recently updated, thanks much to @benjamin_feder.\nThere are a total of 339 exercises. Answers to the odd questions are at the end of the text, and solutions are available for instructors.\nWe are extremely appreciative to @MT_statistics, Melinda Yager, and Randy Prium for their valuable feedback and review of the book.\nIMS builds on the @openintroorg text: Introduction to Statistics with Randomization and Simulation, written with David Diez and Christopher Barr.\nWhile we know that there is still work to do, we’ve added a first pass of alternative text tags to the diagrams in the html version of the text.\nThe book uses many of the OpenIntro datasets. The OpenIntro package has recently been updated on CRAN.\nThe book aligns with many of the OpenIntro education resources.\n\n\n\nThe source code for the text of the book is available on GitHub.\nWhile the Labs and Tutorials are written in the statistical software R, the text itself is software agnostic and can be used with your favorite classroom statistical software.\nFor their amazing art and creative vision, we are indebted to Meenal Patel, @iowio, Muge Cetinkaya, and Will Gray.\nThanks @rundel for the many ways you’ve supported the project.\nShout out to #rstats and RStudio (er, posit) for making amazing products on which our work is based.\nAnd last, thanks to @minebocek for writing my favorite exercise of the text:\n\n\n\nWe hope you enjoy using the text as much as we’ve enjoyed writing it. Have fun!"

    "text": "Definitions\nA case-control study is one in which the observational units are selected in such a way that there are a set number of cases and a set number of controls. (As compared with a cohort study where the observational units are selected in such a way that there are a set number in treatment group 1 and a set number in treatment group 2.)\n\nTypes of Studies\n\nExplanatory variable is one that is a potential explanation for any changes in the response variable.\nResponse variable is the measured outcome of interest.\nCase-control study: identify observational units by response (i.e., case or control).\nCohort study: identify observational units by explanatory variable (i.e., treatment or placebo).\nCross-classification study: identify observational units regardless of levels of the variable.\n\n\n\nRelative Risk\nThe relative risk (RR) is the ratio of risks for each group. We say, “The risk of success is RR times for those in group 1 as compared to those in group 2.”\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mbox{relative risk} &= \\frac{\\mbox{risk group 1}}{\\mbox{risk group 2}}\\\\\n&=  \\frac{\\mbox{proportion of successes in group 1}}{\\mbox{proportion of successes in group 2}}\\\\\n\\mbox{RR} &= \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\\\\n\\hat{\\mbox{RR}} &= \\frac{\\hat{p}_1}{\\hat{p}_2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\nOdds Ratio\nA related concept to risk is odds. It is often used in horse racing, where “success” is typically defined as losing. So, if the odds are 3 to 1 we would expect to lose 3/4 of the time. The odds ratio (OR) is the ratio of odds for each group. We say, “The odds of success is OR times for those in group 1 as compared to those group 2.”\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\mbox{odds} &=& \\frac{\\mbox{proportion of successes}}{\\mbox{proportion of failures}}\\\\\n&=& \\frac{\\mbox{number of successes}}{\\mbox{number of failures}} = \\theta\\\\\n\\hat{\\mbox{odds}} &=& \\hat{\\theta}\\\\\n\\mbox{odds ratio} &=& \\frac{\\mbox{odds group 1}}{\\mbox{odds group 2}} \\\\\n\\mbox{OR} &=& \\frac{\\theta_1}{\\theta_2} = \\frac{p_1/(1-p_1)}{p_2/(1-p_2)}= \\frac{p_1/(1-p_1)}{p_2/(1-p_2)}\\\\\n\\hat{\\mbox{OR}} &=& \\frac{\\hat{\\theta}_1}{\\hat{\\theta}_2} = \\frac{\\hat{p}_1/(1-\\hat{p}_1)}{\\hat{p}_2/(1-\\hat{p}_2)}\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]"

    "text": "Are odds difficult to understand?\nIf you, like me, grew up in a world of proportions and percentages, the first time you encounter odds, it might seem like an odd statistic. However, I’d like to argue that, fundamentally, the idea of odds is no different from the idea of risk (or proportion). The cognitive difficulty in remembering and communicating about odds comes with the fact that we’ve wired our brains so completely to think primarily about proportions.\nBut what if you had grown up thinking about odds? What if you had had a placement at your kitchen table describing the odds of an event (instead of the proportion of the event)? You might find that the odds are actually easier to interpret than a proportion.\nI posit that if you (or your students) had grown up with a kitchen table placemat as seen in Figure 2, you would find risk to be the odd concept and odds to be the intuitive idea.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A child’s kitchen placemat designed to teach proportions, often called risk in medical studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: An alternative child’s kitchen placemat designed to teach odds."

    "text": "Can we force the RR to be anything we want?\nThe motivation for writing this blog entry came from the Shiny App below. It takes a little bit of thinking, but hopefully we can see that if we select observational units based on cases and controls, the individual risk (per treatment group) is not measurable. Why? Well, if we just keep selecting more cases, the risk in each group will keep going up! (Note: by selecting more cases, the odds will also keep going up.)\nWhat about relative risk and odds ratios? It turns out that with the case-control experimental design the calculation of the relative risk depends on which variable is explanatory and which variable is response. HOWEVER, the calculation of the odds ratio does not depend on which variable is explanatory and which variable is response.\nConclusion Regardless of how many cases or controls are sampled, the odds ratio calculated from data in a case control-study is a good estimate of the population odds ratio."

But remember, risk and odds are different numbers (see Figure 1 and Figure 2), so odds ratios and relative risk measure quotients of different things.\n\n\nCan you explain that calculation part one more time?\nExample taken from Introduction to Statistical Concepts, Applications, and Methods by Chance and Rossman.\nLet’s say we have a population of 1,000,000 people:\n\n\n\n\ncancer\nhealthy\n\n\n\n\n\nlight smoking\n49,000\n51,000\n100,000\n\n\nno smoking\n1,000\n899,000\n900,000\n\n\n\n50,000\n950,000\n1,000,000\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\nP(\\mbox{light} | \\mbox{lung cancer}) &=& \\frac{49,000}{50,000} = 0.98\\\\\nP(\\mbox{lung cancer} | \\mbox{light}) &=& \\frac{49,000}{100,000} = 0.49\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\n\n\n\nGroup A\nGroup B\n\n\n\n\nexpl = smoking status\nexpl = lung cancer\n\n\nresp = lung cancer\nresp = smoking status\n\n\n\n\nGroup A: Calculate the relative risk and odds ratio under the setting that lung cancer is considered a success and no smoking is baseline:\n\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\nRR &=& \\frac{49/100}{1/900} = 441\\\\\nOR &=& \\frac{49/51}{1/899} = 863.75\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\n\nGroup B: Calculate the relative risk and odds ratio under the setting that light smoking is considered a success and healthy is baseline:\n\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\nRR &=& \\frac{49/50}{51/950} = 18.25\\\\\nOR &=& \\frac{49/1}{51/899} = 863.75\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nOR is the same no matter which variable you choose as explanatory versus response!\n\n\nAre OR and RR ever numerically similar / equivalent?\nIf \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\) are both very small, then \\[1-p_1 \\approx 1- p_2 \\approx 1\\] which gives:\n\\[RR = \\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx \\frac{p_1 / (1 - p_1)}{p_2/(1-p_2)} = OR.\\]\nIn situations of extremely rare diseases (and case-control studies), it makes sense to calculate the odds ratio and interpret the number as if it was relative risk.\n\n\nOR is always more extreme than RR\nWithout loss of generality, assume the true \\(RR &gt; 1\\), implying \\(p_1 / p_2 &gt; 1\\) and \\(p_1 &gt; p_2\\).\nNote the following sequence of consequences:\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\nRR = \\frac{p_1}{p_2} &&gt;& 1\\\\\n\\frac{1 - p_1}{1 - p_2} &&lt;& 1\\\\\n\\frac{ 1 / (1 - p_1)}{1 / (1 - p_2)} &&gt;& 1\\\\\n\\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\cdot \\frac{ 1 / (1 - p_1)}{1 / (1 - p_2)} &&gt;& \\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\\\\nOR &&gt;& RR\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]"

Intensive one-on-one faculty-student advising, weekly group lunch meetings, and within-course clusters help the group build cohesion and navigate their first year on campus.\nLearning Communities (LiCMATH) - A learning community is a small group of students who are all enrolled in one particular class. They commit to work together and to support each other throughout the semester. A learning community is meant to become a supportive and safe space to work on homework problems, to discuss the lectures, and to bounce ideas off each other. The meetings take place outside of class times, and, at least initially, under the supervision of an upper class undergraduate student mentor.\nPomona Academy of Youth Success (PAYS) - PAYS is a Pomona College summer academic program for high school students. Each four week session is intensely academic, and its core consists of each cohort taking two classes that are taught by regular college faculty: a math class and a humanities/social sciences class. Afternoons are focused on working collaboratively on homework, workshops on college application processes, and enrichment activities. The faculty are aided by a group of dedicated undergraduate students who serve as teaching assistants to the faculty and as mentors to the students.\nAssociation for Women in Mathematics (AWM) Student Chapter - AWM is a professional organization designed to support women in mathematics. Our local chapter provides space for our students to flourish and feel supported.\nEnhancing Diversity in Graduate Education (EDGE) - EDGE is a summer program for women entering graduate school. Hosted regularly in Claremont with many of our faculty involved, the program balances academic rigor and intersectional support.\n\nMathematicians of the African Diaspora (MAD) - The MAD pages highlight work done by mathematicians who are members of the African diaspora. Working the comprehensively collect information, the pages are continually updated.\n\nPomona Research in Mathematics Experience (PRiME) - PRiME is an eight week intensive summer research experience in pure mathematics."

    "text": "Hi and welcome to my site!\nSince 2002, I have been at Pomona College where I teach lots of different kinds of statistics, taught a little bit of math once, love teaching writing with statistics, and hope to soon teach some data science.\n\nBackground\n\nMy undergraduate degree in Mathematics is also from Pomona College, where I worked with Don Bentley. I did my PhD in Statistics at UC Davis with David Rocke. I was interviewed (August 2020) for Pomona College’s Sagecast where you can hear me talk about my path.\n\nHere to learn?\n\nMe too! So many good things to learn. I’ve posted all of my course materials freely, and I hope they give you inspiration either as a teacher or a student. I’ve also written an OpenIntro  textbook with the fantastic Mine Çentinkaya-Rundel. Introduction to Modern Statistics focuses on computational inference and multivariable modeling & visualizing, and it is available for free online.\n\nInterested in my research?\n\nOne of the best things about being a statistician is the many different subject areas to pursue. My research projects are posted, but if you have time, it’s really my students’ research projects that are worth investigating. I highly recommend working with undergraduates on research as it is among the most fun and rewarding parts of my day.\nMy areas of expertise include statistical analysis of high-throughput genetic data which don’t conform to technical conditions in standard methods. I work on problems of normalizing data structures, clustering and classifying time course profiles, and creating metrics to measure a variety of signals. I chose to become a statistician because of the myriad potential collaborations across many fields. I have worked with medical doctors, biologists, geologists, and physicists in my research.\nAnother area of my research focuses on the statistics and data science undergraduate curriculum – making it more modern and more accessible. Through new ventures into data science (both research and teaching), I am currently exploring ways that today’s extensive data (both in scale and in occurrence) are shaping science and the world around us.\n\nWant to know what I’m up to?\n\nBeyond teaching and research, I am fortunate to be able to fit in a few hours here and there on some of my passion projects. Almost every Tuesday, I wrangle a bit of TidyTuesday data. I’m also compiling a list of scholars who are traditionally underrepresented in the statistics and data science curriculum. Feel free to use the list for your own “scholar of the day” classroom activity. And please submit a pull request or a GitHub issue if you have names to add to the database!"

When you submit the rest of the materials below, please include the response you’ve gotten from the organization about their policy on recieving a letter directly from me (instead of from you)."
