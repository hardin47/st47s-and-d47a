## my background

Since 2002, I have been at [Pomona College](https://www.pomona.edu/academics/departments/mathematics), where: I teach lots of different kinds of statistics, taught a little bit of math once, love teaching writing with statistics, and have recently begun teaching data science.

My undergraduate degree is also from Pomona College, in Mathematics where I worked with Don Bentley.  I did my PhD in Statistics at [UC Davis](https://statistics.ucdavis.edu/) with [David Rocke](http://dmrocke.ucdavis.edu/).  

My current [research](/research/) interests include:

<h3>{{< iconify fa-solid chart-line >}}  &nbsp; Statistical methods for high-throughput data</h3>
<h3> {{< iconify fa sitemap >}}  &nbsp; Inference in machine learning</h3>
<h3> {{< iconify fa-solid chalkboard-teacher >}}  &nbsp; Statistics and data science education</h3>
<h3>{{< iconify iconamoon sign-equal-bold >}}  &nbsp; Equity and flourishing in statistics and data science</h3>
