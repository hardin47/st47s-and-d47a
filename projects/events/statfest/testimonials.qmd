<h2>Quotes from Michael Thomas</h2>

<h3>Why StatFest is important to me?</h3>

Every time I attend StatFest it revitalizes my interest in pushing myself as a statistician. After I get back to work, I feel encouraged to approach my regular problems with the perspectives of my peers in mind. I always come home with at least one new idea concept I learned from a peer. 

<h3>What I have gotten out of participating?</h3>
I have strengthened my network in the field. I work outside of academia, so it isn't implied that I will come into contact with other statisticians. StatFest gives me the opportunity to share experiences with other statisticians who speak a common language.

<h3>Why I have attended?</h3>
I attended StatFest to help contribute to our knowledge as a group. I was able to provide information to grad students and undergraduates that I didn't have easy access to when I was in their position. It's gratifying to be able to help them make decisions at such an exciting time in their life!
