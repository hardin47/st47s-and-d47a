StatFest is a one day conference aimed at encouraging undergraduate students from historically underrepresented groups (African American, Hispanic, Native Americans) to consider careers and graduate studies in the statistical sciences.  StatFest 2018 will be taking place on Saturday, September 22nd.  Be sure to sign up today (see below)!

StatFest is an ongoing initiative of the American Statistical Association (ASA) through its Committee on Minorities in Statistics. 

The conference includes:

- presentations from established professionals, academic leaders, and current graduate students that will help attendees understand the opportunities and routes for success in the field,
- opportunities for networking,
- opportunity for attendees to submit and present posters describing their research, and
- panel forums that will provide information and tips for a rewarding graduate student experience, achieving success as an academic statistician, opportunities in the private and government arenas, among other topics.



We are excited that StatFest 2018 will be held at <a href="https://www.amherst.edu" target="_blank">Amherst College</a> (Amherst, Massachusetts), one of the premier liberal arts colleges in the nation, enrolling 1,800 talented, energetic and diverse young men and women.  Amherst is one of the most diverse liberal arts colleges in the country. Our dedication to the centrality of inclusiveness helps us ensure that the college is a place to which all students feel they [belong](http://www.jkcf.org/amherst-college-gets-1-million-cooke-prize-for-admitting-supporting-and-graduating-outstanding-low-income-students).
