<h2>Nearest airports and transportation connections</h2>

The closest airport (55 minutes) is Bradley International ([BDL](http://www.bradleyairport.com), Hartford CT/Springfield MA).  Boston's Logan airport ([BOS](http://www.massport.com/logan-airport)) is approximately two hours (depending on traffic) from Amherst College.  

Options for airport connections from BDL include [Valley Transporter](https://www.valleytransporter.com/) (approximately $60 each direction) and rental cars (for those 25 or older).

Note that there are relatively few departures from Bradley airport on Saturday evenings.  

<h2>Hotels</h2>
Fall weekends are very popular with visitors to New England and as a result, hotel availability is limited.  Participants in StatFest are encouraged <b>to make arrangements early and carefully review the deadlines for the room blocks that we have negotiated.</b>

Participants should make their own arrangements directly with the hotel of their choice. Special discounted rates were negotiated with the hotels listed below. Rates quoted do not include hotel tax. Participants must state that they are with StatFest to receive the discounted rates. 

We are not responsible for rate changes or for the quality of the accommodations. Hotels have varying cancellation and early checkout penalties; be sure to ask for details.

It may be possible to arrange shuttles to StatFest to and from these hotels.  Shuttle transfers need to be requested by September 15th.
