## Introduction to Modern Statistics

**Introduction to Modern Statistics** is now out!  See the web version at https://openintro.org/book/ims/online and information on how to find the PDF and paperback versions at https://openintro.org/book/ims/.  
 
Introduction to Modern Statistics puts a heavy emphasis on exploratory data analysis (specifically exploring multivariate relationships using visualization, summarization, and descriptive models) and provides a thorough discussion of simulation-based inference using randomization and bootstrapping, followed by a presentation of the related Central Limit Theorem based approaches.
 
A few more highlights from the book include:

* Emphasis on multivariable relationships, particularly using data visualization.
* Early introduction to descriptive models and a second look at models for inference and model validation.
* A case study accompanying each part.
* Interactive R tutorials and R labs presented alongside the related content.
* Compelling exploratory data analysis of relevant datasets and with modern visualizations.
 
The text is suitable for use in introductory statistics and data science courses as well as an upper-level course that dives deeper into comparisons among computational and mathematical methods presented in the book.
