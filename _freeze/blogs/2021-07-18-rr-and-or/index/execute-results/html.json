We say, \"The risk of success is **RR** times for those in group 1 as compared to those in group 2.\"\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mbox{relative risk} &= \\frac{\\mbox{risk group 1}}{\\mbox{risk group 2}}\\\\\n&=  \\frac{\\mbox{proportion of successes in group 1}}{\\mbox{proportion of successes in group 2}}\\\\\n\\mbox{RR} &= \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\\\\n\\hat{\\mbox{RR}} &= \\frac{\\hat{p}_1}{\\hat{p}_2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n#### **Odds Ratio** \nA related concept to risk is odds.\nIt is often used in horse racing, where \"success\" is typically defined as losing.  So, if the odds are 3 to 1 we would expect to lose 3/4 of the time.\nThe odds ratio (OR) is the ratio of odds for each group.\nWe say, \"The odds of success is **OR** times for those in group 1 as compared to those group 2.\"\n\n\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\mbox{odds} &=& \\frac{\\mbox{proportion of successes}}{\\mbox{proportion of failures}}\\\\\n&=& \\frac{\\mbox{number of successes}}{\\mbox{number of failures}} = \\theta\\\\\n\\hat{\\mbox{odds}} &=& \\hat{\\theta}\\\\\n\\mbox{odds ratio} &=& \\frac{\\mbox{odds group 1}}{\\mbox{odds group 2}} \\\\\n\\mbox{OR} &=& \\frac{\\theta_1}{\\theta_2} = \\frac{p_1/(1-p_1)}{p_2/(1-p_2)}= \\frac{p_1/(1-p_1)}{p_2/(1-p_2)}\\\\\n\\hat{\\mbox{OR}} &=& \\frac{\\hat{\\theta}_1}{\\hat{\\theta}_2} = \\frac{\\hat{p}_1/(1-\\hat{p}_1)}{\\hat{p}_2/(1-\\hat{p}_2)}\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\n\n## Are odds difficult to understand?\n\nIf you, like me, grew up in a world of proportions and percentages, the first time you encounter odds, it might seem like an *odd* statistic. \nHowever, I'd like to argue that, fundamentally, the idea of odds is no different from the idea of risk (or proportion). \nThe cognitive difficulty in remembering and communicating about odds comes with the fact that we've wired our brains so completely to think primarily about proportions.  \n\nBut what if you had grown up thinking about odds? \nWhat if you had had a placement at your kitchen table describing the odds of an event (instead of the proportion of the event)? \nYou might find that the odds are actually easier to interpret than a proportion.\n\nI posit that if you (or your students) had grown up with a kitchen table placemat as seen in @fig-oddspm, you would find risk to be the *odd* concept and odds to be the intuitive idea.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A child's kitchen placemat designed to teach proportions, often called risk in medical studies.](riskplacemat.png){#fig-riskpm fig-alt='Six different pie charts are shown, each with a different number of equivalently sized pie pieces colored either blue or orange.

It takes a little bit of thinking, but hopefully we can see that if we select observational units based on cases and controls, the individual risk (per treatment group) is not measurable. Why?  Well, if we just keep selecting more cases, the risk in each group will keep going up!  (Note: by selecting more cases, the odds will also keep going up.)\n\nWhat about **relative risk** and **odds ratios**?  It turns out that with the case-control experimental design the calculation of the relative risk depends on which variable is explanatory and which variable is response.  HOWEVER, the calculation of the odds ratio does not depend on which variable is explanatory and which variable is response.\n\n**Conclusion**  Regardless of how many cases or controls are sampled, the odds ratio calculated from data in a case control-study is a good estimate of the population odds ratio.\n\n<iframe height=\"800\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://hardin47.shinyapps.io/RROR/\"> </iframe>\n\n## More thoughts on RR and OR\n\n####  Odds Ratios are hard to interpret\n\nAfter an odds ratio (of XXX) has been calculated, the correct interpretation is that the odds of success for group 1 are XXX times the odds of success for group 2.\nThere might be a tendency to say that the probability of success (or risk of success) in group 1 are XXX times that of group 2.\nBut remember, risk and odds are different numbers (see @fig-riskpm and @fig-oddspm), so odds ratios and relative risk measure quotients of different things.\n\n#### Can you explain that calculation part one more time?\n\nExample taken from [Introduction to Statistical Concepts, Applications, and Methods](http://www.rossmanchance.com/iscam3/) by Chance and Rossman.\n\n\nLet's say we have a *population* of 1,000,000 people:\n\n|               | cancer | healthy |           |\n|---------------|--------|---------|-----------|\n| light smoking | 49,000 | 51,000  | 100,000   |\n| no smoking    | 1,000  | 899,000 | 900,000   |\n|               | 50,000 | 950,000 | 1,000,000 |\n\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nP(\\mbox{light} | \\mbox{lung cancer}) &=& \\frac{49,000}{50,000} = 0.98\\\\\nP(\\mbox{lung cancer} | \\mbox{light}) &=& \\frac{49,000}{100,000} = 0.49\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\n\n\n| Group A \t| Group B \t|\n|-----------------------\t|-----------------------\t|\n| expl = smoking status \t| expl = lung cancer \t|\n| resp = lung cancer \t| resp = smoking status \t|\n\n\n* Group A:  Calculate the relative risk and odds ratio under the setting that lung cancer is considered a success and no smoking is baseline:\n\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nRR &=& \\frac{49/100}{1/900} = 441\\\\\nOR &=& \\frac{49/51}{1/899} = 863.75\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\n* Group B:  Calculate the relative risk and odds ratio under the setting that light smoking is considered a success and healthy is baseline:\n\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nRR &=& \\frac{49/50}{51/950} = 18.25\\\\\nOR &=& \\frac{49/1}{51/899} = 863.75\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\n\nOR is the same no matter which variable you choose as explanatory versus response!  \n\n\n#### Are OR and RR ever numerically similar / equivalent?\n\nIf $p_1$ and $p_2$ are both very small, then \n$$1-p_1 \\approx 1- p_2 \\approx 1$$\nwhich gives:\n\n$$RR = \\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\approx \\frac{p_1 / (1 - p_1)}{p_2/(1-p_2)} = OR.$$\n\nIn situations of extremely rare diseases (and case-control studies), it makes sense to calculate the odds ratio and interpret the number as if it was relative risk.\n\n#### OR is always more extreme than RR\n\nWithout loss of generality, assume the true $RR > 1$, implying $p_1 / p_2 > 1$ and $p_1 > p_2$.\n\nNote the following sequence of consequences:\n\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nRR = \\frac{p_1}{p_2} &>& 1\\\\\n\\frac{1 - p_1}{1 - p_2} &<& 1\\\\\n\\frac{ 1 / (1 - p_1)}{1 / (1 - p_2)} &>& 1\\\\\n\\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\cdot \\frac{ 1 / (1 - p_1)}{1 / (1 - p_2)} &>& \\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\\\\nOR &>& RR\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n",
