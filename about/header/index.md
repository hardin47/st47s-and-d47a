Hi and welcome to my site! 

Since 2002, I have been at <a href = "https://www.pomona.edu/academics/departments/mathematics">Pomona College</a> where I teach lots of different kinds of statistics, taught a little bit of math once, love teaching writing with statistics, and hope to soon teach some data science.

<h4> Background </h4>
My undergraduate degree in Mathematics is also from <a href = "https://www.pomona.edu/academics/departments/mathematics">Pomona College</a>, where I worked with Don Bentley.  I did my PhD in Statistics at <a href="https://statistics.ucdavis.edu/">UC Davis</a> with <a href = "http://dmrocke.ucdavis.edu/">David Rocke</a>.  I was interviewed (August 2020) for <a href = "https://www.pomona.edu/sagecast" target = "_blank">Pomona College's Sagecast</a> where you can hear me talk about my path.

<h4>Here to learn?</h4>
Me too!
So many good things to learn.
I've posted all of my <a href="/courses/">course materials</a> freely, and I hope they give you inspiration either as a teacher or a student.
I've also written an <a href="https://www.openintro.org/">OpenIntro </a> textbook with the fantastic <a href="http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mc301/">Mine Çentinkaya-Rundel</a>. <a href="https://www.openintro.org/book/ims/">Introduction to Modern Statistics</a> focuses on computational inference and multivariable modeling & visualizing, and it is available for free online.

<h4>Interested in my research?</h4>
One of the best things about being a statistician is the many different subject areas to pursue.  My <a href="/research/">research projects</a> are posted, but if you have time, it's really my <a href="/research/">students' research projects</a> that are worth investigating.  I highly recommend working with undergraduates on research as it is among the most fun and rewarding parts of my day.

My areas of expertise include statistical analysis of high-throughput genetic data which don’t conform to technical conditions in standard methods.
I work on problems of normalizing data structures, clustering and classifying time course profiles, and creating metrics to measure a variety of signals.

I chose to become a statistician because of the myriad potential collaborations across many fields.
I have worked with medical doctors, biologists, geologists, and physicists in my research.  Through new ventures into data science (both research and teaching), I am currently exploring ways that today’s extensive data (both in scale and in occurrence) are shaping science and the world around us.  


<h4>Want to know what I'm up to?</h4>
Beyond teaching and research, I am fortunate to be able to fit in a few hours here and there on some of my <a href="/projects/">passion projects</a>.  Almost every Tuesday, I wrangle a bit of <a href="/projects/tidytuesday">TidyTuesday</a> data.  I'm also compiling a <a href="/projects/curv">list of scholars</a> who are traditionally underrepresented in the statistics and data science curriculum.  Feel free to use the list for your own "scholar of the day" classroom activity.  And please submit a pull request or a GitHub issue if you have names to add to the database!
