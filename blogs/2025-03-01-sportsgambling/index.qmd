I don't know the full history or choices along the way that built the 20th and 21st century math curriculum in California public schools, or anywhere else, for that matter.  But I do know that the space race in the 1950s and 60s and the related Cold War throughout the second half of the 20th century drew the best and the brightest of our students into physics.  In terms of mathematics, calculus is fundamental to understanding physics and working in any of the related fields, including astronomy and engineering. So it doesn't surprise me that our public schools contain mathematics curricula that build directly toward the top students completing a two-course sequence of Calculus 1 and Calculus 2 by the time they graduate from high school.

But there is a case to be made that our national interests have changed, and it might be in our best interests to take domestic threats more seriously. In particular, I believe that our we do a disservice to our high school students when they graduate without having engaged with statistics, modeling, or really any data analysis at all.  

Below I detail some of the ongoing debates happening in the state of California. I also describe one of our newest threats to poverty and income inequality: online sports gambling.  And while I know that we need to continue to train some of our students in calculus (we still need physicists, after all!), I would like to see the structure of the curriculum flipped so that most students are focused on data acumen skills and some students are focused on calculus skills.


## The California Debate

In 2020, the UC Board of Admissions and Relations with Schools (BOARS) for the University of California system (including UC Berkeley and UCLA) <a href = "https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/committees/boars/documents/statement-on-mathematics-preparation-for-uc.pdf" target = "_blank">decided</a> that the Algebra II requirement could be fulfilled instead by students who had taken Data Science or Statistics. While the 2020 BOARS decision was grounded in being an "equity issue", they also "strongly encouraged [students] to consider a math course sequence that prepares them for calculus."  Which reads as if they still believe that calculus should be the pinnacle of high school mathematics but that not everyone has access to get there.

Recently, BOARS has revisited their 2020 decision, spurred on partly by mathematicians who believe data science is dumbing down the mathematics curriculum.  In 2023, more that four hundred faculty from California institutions signed on to an <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/mathindatamatters/home" target = "_blank">open letter</a>, which argues, among other things, that the only reasonable path for any STEM major is the Algebra II to Calculus pathway. In contrast, David Bressoud (DeWitt Wallace Professor Emeritus, Macalester College) explained in 2020 how broken the calculus pathway really is, and he <a href = "https://www.mathvalues.org/masterblog/launchings20201001" target = "_blank">argues for</a> a "truly co-equal path that develops computational and data skills." In 2024, <a href = "https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/committees/boars/documents/boarsacwphase1report-20240221.pdf" target = "_blank">BOARS reversed their 2020 decision</a> and reverted to requiring Algebra II as a requirement to attend a University of California institution.

## Sports Gambling

The high school / university curricular debate aside, it is worth considering **why** the debate feels so important. The Stanford History Education Group did <a href = "https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:fv751yt5934/SHEG%20Evaluating%20Information%20Online.pdf" target = "_blank">an extensive analysis</a> to assess college students' online reasoning.  They found that their ability to reason about information on the internet was "bleak". The students were unable to reason through why they should or shouldn't believe a particular online claim.  The study found that students accepted as truth the information presented to them, even when there was no supporting evidence or citations.

In May 2018, the US Supreme Court struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), a law that prevented gambling on both collegiate and professional sports. In the wake of that decision, sports gambling has become ubiquitous, particularly within online platforms. That is, the dismantling of the regulation opened the doors, but online technology opened the flood gates. Websites like FanDuel and DraftKings make it remarkably simply to connect your bank account to the gambling platform, and they bombard you with exciting opportunities to win big. 

One of the main ways that online gambling platforms makes money is through something called a parlay bet. A parlay is a type of bet in which multiple selections are made on different events (e.g., LA Dodgers win the game **and** Ohtani hits a home run at some point during the game **and** someone scores in the first inning). It is difficult to win a parlay bet because each event must come out in your favor in order to win. On the flip side, the platform pays long odds (extra money) for those times when the parlay does win.  The long odds make the bet seem like a good idea.  Unsurprisingly to mathematicians, however, <a href = "https://leans.ai/betting/how-to/are-parlays-worth-it/" target = "_blank">"the bookmakers are taking advantage of the increased risk involved in a parlay by offering lower odds"</a> than would be reasonable.  And certainly, the platform would not allow you to take the other side of the parlay bet. That is, the platform offers a big payout if your parlay wins, but if the betting market were even somewhat close to fair, the offer should be for a truly ginormous payout if your parlay wins.

Understanding the concept of expected value (the long run average on the return of, say, a parlay bet) is paramount to being able to know whether the online gaming platforms are taking advantage of their users (spoiler: they are).  Season 4 of Michael Lewis' podcast, <a href = "https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/against-the-rules" target = "_blank">Against the Rules</a>, walks through how being data illiterate leaves you open to being taken advantage of by online gaming platforms. He describes the tactics that the industries use (e.g., not allowing large bets from individuals who win) that take advantage of a population of people who are not trained to understand critical reasoning through data. The podcast serves as a warning for anyone considering online sports gambling, but it is only one small directive in a sea of industries set up to take advantage of people who are not trained to understand data, evidence, and reasoning.  All important concepts taught in a data science course.

## Recommendation

In the end, I find the debate between Algebra II and Data Science to be distracting. I think the material in both classes is incredibly important. But when it comes to serving the vast majority of high school students in California public schools, I believe that the material in a data science or statistics courses is more incredibly important. That is, I'd like to see us focus on how we can get every single high school student graduating with some kind of training in data. While I recognize that there is only so much space in a high school curriculum, I advocate for data training above most other things.  I worry that we do our students a disservice when we send them out into a world designed and optimized to take advantage of them. It is in our national interest to train students to be wary consumers who understand how the data around them is being used purposefully to enrich large corporations and their CEOs. Let's take care of each other and teach our students what they need to know.
