## research interests:

I chose to become a statistician because of the myriad of different mathematical applications to the real world available in the field.
In particular, I've been able to work with molecular biologists thinking about new ways to work with high throughput data.  
I've also recently My work involves analysis of different types of microarray (genetic) data that donâ€™t conform to the usual assumptions needed for statistical analyses. Currently, I am developing new statistical techniques to analyze such data with particular interest in clustering, correlation, and outlier detection.
