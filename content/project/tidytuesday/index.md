I try my best to put in a few Tuesday hours working on a TidyTuesday dataset when I can.
If you are in Claremont, I hope you will join us; reach out to me for information on time and place.


* Official GitHub Repo for TidyTuesday: <a href = "https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday" target = "_blank">https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday</a>
* The weekâ€™s data is posted each Tuesday on GitHub: <a href = "https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2022" target = "_blank">https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2022</a>

## Novice

* Log in to <a href = "https://rstudio.cloud/" target = "_blank">https://rstudio.cloud/</a> (if you are a Pomona student, use your abc0123@mymail email address to connect on the cloud with slightly higher bandwith / support).  
* If you go to Pomona College, log in to Pomona's RStudio server at <a href = "https://rstudio.pomona.edu/" target = "_blank">https://rstudio.pomona.edu/</a>
* Or download R and RStudio (both free) onto your own computer.  R is available at <a href="http://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">http://www.r-project.org/</a>. Additionally, install RStudio in order to use RMarkdown, <a href="http://rstudio.org/" target="_blank">http://rstudio.org/</a>.  

To load the data in, create an R chunk and copy in the lines of code which are just below the phrase: `# Or read in the data manually` on the `tidytuesday` GitHub site for the particular day of interest.  It will look something like this:

````r
```{r}
dataset_1 <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/some_date/dataset_1.csv')

dataset_2 <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/some_date/dataset_2.csv')
```
````
