I believe that DEI work takes all of us contributing in myriad ways.  One of the things I've realized recently is that there isn't a magic bullet or a single effort which will ameliorate the centuries of problematic structures which have been created.  I don't pretend to have the answers. But I do continue to work hard to create environments where more and more of us feel welcome and heard.  Below I've listed current activities, most of which I am very actively engaged.  A few represent programs I work with peripherally and/or support students attending.


## <a href = "https://www.pomona.edu/academics/departments/mathematics" target = "_blank">Department of Mathematics & Statistics</a>


As a group, we are involved in many fabulous programs.

* <a href = "https://www.pomona.edu/academics/academic-support-resources/academic-cohorts-pomona-college" target= "_blank">Pomona Scholars of Mathematics (PSM)</a> - PSM is a cohort program targeted at first year students who are interested in studying math or related disciplines (e.g., computer science, statistics, physics).  Intensive one-on-one faculty-student advising, weekly group lunch meetings, and within-course clusters help the group build cohesion and navigate their first year on campus.
* <a href = "https://www.pomona.edu/academics/departments/mathematics/resources/learning-community-mathematics-licmath" target = "_blank">Learning Communities (LiCMATH)</a> - A learning community is a small group of students who are all enrolled in one particular class.  They commit to work together and to support each other throughout the semester. A learning community is meant to become a supportive and safe space to work on homework problems, to discuss the lectures, and to bounce ideas off each other.  The meetings take place outside of class times, and, at least initially, under the supervision of an upper class undergraduate student mentor. 
* <a href = "https://www.pomona.edu/administration/draper-center/pays/what-is-pays" target = "_blank">Pomona Academy of Youth Success (PAYS)</a> - PAYS is a Pomona College summer academic program for high school students. Each four week session is intensely academic, and its core consists of each cohort taking two classes that are taught by regular college faculty: a math class and a humanities/social sciences class. Afternoons are focused on working collaboratively on homework, workshops on college application processes, and enrichment activities. The faculty are aided by a group of dedicated undergraduate students who serve as teaching assistants to the faculty and as mentors to the students.
* <a href = "https://www.pomona.edu/academics/departments/mathematics/students/association-women-mathematics-student-chapter" target = "_blank">Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) Student Chapter</a> - AWM is a professional organization designed to support women in mathematics.  Our local chapter provides space for our students to flourish and feel supported.
* <a href = "https://www.edgeforwomen.org/" target = "_blank">Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education (EDGE)</a> - EDGE is a summer program for women entering graduate school.  Hosted regularly in Claremont with many of our faculty involved, the program balances academic rigor and intersectional support.  
* <a href = "" target = "_blank">Mathematicians of the African Diaspora (MAD)</a> - The MAD pages highlight work done by mathematicians who are members of the African diaspora.  Working the comprehensively collect information, the pages are continually updated.  
* <a href = "https://ehgoins.wixsite.com/prime" target = "_blank">Pomona Research in Mathematics Experience (PRiME)</a> - PRiME is an eight week intensive summer research experience in pure mathematics. 

## Pomona College

* Inclusive Excellence Committee

> The mission of the Inclusive Excellence Committee will be to advance the practice of inclusive excellence at Pomona College. The Institute will achieve this mission through faculty professional development in inclusive teaching and mentorship, and through research that informs decision making and drives institutional change to further equity initiatives at the College.

* <a href = "https://www.pomona.edu/students/academic-awards-and-distinctions" target = "_blank">Phi Beta Kappa</a> at Pomona College was recently <a href = "https://www.pomona.edu/news/2021/10/14-pomonas-phi-beta-kappa-chapter-recognized-diversity-and-inclusion-efforts" target = "_blank">recognized</a> for diversity and inclusion efforts.

## Professional Outreach


* The <a href = "https://www.amstat.org/" target = "_blank">American Statistical Association</a> has recently put together an outreach group focused on <a href = "http://www.datascijedi.org/" target = "_blank">Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion</a>.  Read about the JEDI work <a href = "https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2021/05/01/the-origins-of-jedi/" target = "_blank">here</a> and follow us on <a href = "https://twitter.com/DataSciJedi" target="_blank"> twitter</a>.

* <a href = "https://community.amstat.org/cmis/events/statfest" target = "_blank">StatFest</a> is a one-day conference focused on encouraging undergraduate students who are traditionally underrepresented in statistics to consider careers and graduate school in statistics.  In 2018, Pomona College hosted a <a href = "http://st47s.com/statfest.html" target = "_blank">satellite StatFest program</a>.

* In 2021, the Association for Women in Mathematics launched its flagship journal, <a href = "https://awm-math.org/publications/la-matematica/" target = "_blank">La Matematica</a>.  As an associate editor, I work to provide constructive and timely reviews with healthy feedback to the authors.
