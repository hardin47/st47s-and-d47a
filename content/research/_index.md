    almost surely, no problem.  I would be happy to write you a letter.  Help me, help you.  The more information you can provide for me, the better my letter will be.  Also, send the same information about your situation to your other letter writers.  It will make their letters better, too.

** No content below YAML for the blog _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside blog/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**
