Hi and welcome to my site! 

I have been at [Pomona College](https://www.pomona.edu/academics/departments/mathematics) since 2002 where I teach lots of different kinds of statistics, taught a little bit of math once, love teaching writing with statistics, and hope to soon teach some data science.

My current research interest

<h4> Background </h4>
My undergraduate degree in Mathematics is also from [Pomona College](https://www.pomona.edu/academics/departments/mathematics), where I worked with Don Bentley.  I did my PhD in Statistics at [UC Davis](https://statistics.ucdavis.edu/) with [David Rocke](http://dmrocke.ucdavis.edu/).
