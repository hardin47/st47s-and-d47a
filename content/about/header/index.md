Hi and welcome to my site! 

I have been at [Pomona College](https://www.pomona.edu/academics/departments/mathematics) since 2002 where I teach lots of different kinds of statistics, taught a little bit of math once, love teaching writing with statistics, and hope to soon teach some data science.

My current research interest

<h4> Background </h4>
My undergraduate degree in Mathematics is also from [Pomona College](https://www.pomona.edu/academics/departments/mathematics), where I worked with Don Bentley.  I did my PhD in Statistics at [UC Davis](https://statistics.ucdavis.edu/) with [David Rocke](http://dmrocke.ucdavis.edu/).  

<h4>Here to learn?</h4>
Me too!
So many good things to learn.
I've posted all of my [course materials](/courses/) freely, and I hope they give you inspiration either as a teacher or a student.
I've also written an [OpenIntro](https://www.openintro.org/) textbook with the fantastic [Mine Ã‡entinkaya-Rundel](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mc301/) called [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/book/ims/) which is available for free online.

<h4>Interested in my research?<h4>
One of the best things about being a statistician is the many different subject areas to pursue.  My [research projects](/research/) are posted, but if you have time, it's really my [students' research projects](/research/) that are worth investigating.  I highly recommend working with undergraduates on research as it is among the most fun and rewarding parts of my day.

<h4>Want to know what I'm up to?<h4>
Beyond teaching and research, I am fortunate to be able to fit in a few hours here and there on some of my [passion projects](/project/).  Almost every Tuesday, I wrangle a bit of [TidyTuesday](/project/tidytuesday/) data.  I'm also compiling a [list of scholars](/project/curv/) who are traditionally underrepresented in the statistics and data science curriculum.  Feel free to use the list for your own "scholar of the day" classroom activity.  And please submit a pull request or a GitHub issue if you have names ot add to the database!
