**Computational Statistics** will be an introduction to statistical methods that rely heavily on the use of computers.
The course will generally have three parts.
The first section will include communicating and working with data in a modern era.
We will cover data wrangling, data visualization, data ethics, and collaborative research (via GitHub).
The second part of the course will focus on traditional statistical inference done through computational methods (e.g., permutation tests, bootstrapping).
The last part of the course will focus on machine learning ideas such as classification, clustering, and (possibly) dimension reduction techniques.
Some of the methods were invented before the ubiquitous use of personal computers, but only because the calculus used to solve the problem was relatively straightforward (or because the method wasn't actually ever used). 
Many of the methods have been developed within the last few years.
