## The Islands

The Islands are a virtual environment designed to engage students in experimental design and data collection.  The basic idea is that people (and their pets!) live on villages spread out along three different islands.  They go to school, get sick, have friends, have jobs, etc.  The individuals are able to do tasks (e.g., drink vodka or run a mile or both!) and to answer questions.  They sleep at night (to the dismay of your night-owl students who want to do their data collection in the wee hours); they sometimes back out of the study; and they sometimes lie to you (e.g., about their age).

If now is the first time you are hearing about The Islands, I recommend that you read what others have written and ask to explore them on your own.  You will be **amazed** at how sophisticated the virtual world is.  

* Michael Bulmer created The Islands and describes them on causeweb.org, <a href="https://www.causeweb.org/cause/resources/library/r12661" target = "_blank">The Islands -- Learning about Experiment Design on a Virtual Population</a> as well as through the <a href = "https://sites.google.com/site/islandsinschoolsprojectwebsite/home" target = "_blank">Islands in Schools Project</a>.
* Michael Bulmer and Kimberly Haladyn (from the University of Queensland, Australia) first published their work creating the virtual world in TISE, <a href = "https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2q0740hv" target = "_blank">Life on an Island: a Simulated Population to Support Student Projects in Statistics</a>.  
* Causeweb.org has hosts multiple past webinars describing different educators use of The Islands in their own classrooms.  Ann Brearley and Laura Le from the University of Minnesota spoke at USCOTS 2017 <a href = "https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots/uscots17/breakout/1G" target = "_blank">1G: Life on an Island: Using a Virtual World to Make Statistics Real<a>; Ryne VanKrevelen, Lisa Rosenberg, and Laura Taylor from Elon University gave a webinar in 2018 <a href = "https://www.causeweb.org/cause/webinar/teaching/2018-08" target = "_blank">Introductory Statistics Projects Using 'The Islands' Virtual World Versus Student-Collected Data</a>.
